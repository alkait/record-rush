# Record Rush! ⏱️

Welcome to Record Rush - an experiment where I challenged AI to create a fully working game without writing a single line of code myself! 🤖✨

Through 4 hours of intense arguments with AI, I've built a game featuring:
- 🎨 Slick UI design
- 🔄 State management
- 🔊 Sound effects
- 👥 Multiplayer support
- 💾 Data persistence
- 🚀 Production deployment
- 🔍 SEO optimization
- 📱 Responsive design

While a stopwatch might seem simple, this experiment demonstrates how AI can supercharge development by shifting focus from writing code to mastering prompt engineering. It's like pair programming, but your partner never needs coffee breaks! ☕

## Features
- Personal record tracking
- Sound effects and visual feedback
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Multiplayer mode with up to 5 players
- Support for both endurance and speed challenges
- Mobile-friendly design
- Local data persistence
